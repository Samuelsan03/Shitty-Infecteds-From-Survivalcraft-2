# Shitty-Infecteds-From-Survivalcraft-2
This is a mod based on Shitty Creatures, introducing new zombie-facing enemies. The difference is that you won't have to rely on the Shitty Creatures mod to play it. Now the question is, what will you do against the infected without your new allies? Will the taming system from Shitty Creatures be retained? The answer is YES, taming will be retained, BUT now as a standalone mod. Bandits and other enemies will also be present in the original mod, but for this independent version. Things will be improved with unique mechanics for the infected, structures like towns and more (both inhabited and abandoned), and of course, the dreaded DayZ-style bandits. There will be a few bandits who can ally with you, but they'll come at a price. And of course, the special infected and boss-type infected will be retained, but with their own independent mechanics. This mod will soon be developed to become independent of Shitty Creatures and things will get even more intense.
